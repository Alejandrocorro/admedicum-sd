                              <div class="card-content-open font-is-20 tk-canada-type-gibson" style="position: unset;" >We embraced admedicum’s services, in collaboration with Trials24, only by the time that we became aware that the inclusion of patients with certain hematologic malignancies in an ongoing phase I study of a PRAME-specific TCR-T was not as expected due to the very restrictive nature of the eligibility criteria. The admedicum team’s experience and creativity towards a fruitful approach to our reality of clinical study conduct within Germany clearly translated in a gateway towards potentially eligible patients, whom, upon a triage, could ultimately be guided in contacting the investigational sites. In concerto, a dedicated website for the specific conditions, use of advertising on social media and local radio presentation by clinical experts and the principal investigator did land a high number of patients or their caregivers to undergo the initial web-based triage towards an improved patient recruitment. Hence I clearly recommend admedicum’s services for clinical studies for which patient recruitment is expected to be difficult, ideally well before the start of the study.</div>

                              <div class="card-content-open font-is-20 tk-canada-type-gibson" style="position: unset;">The Sklerodermie e.V. in connection with the scleroderma experts of the DNSS (German Network for Systemic Scleroderma) asked admedicum for support in conducting a survey among more than 1200 scleroderma patients in Germany. The aim was to investigate the extent to which scleroderma patients benefit from the infusion therapy, which is recommended but currently not refinanced and therefore difficult to obtain. The questionnaire developed by the Sklerodermie Selbsthilfe e.V. and experts in scleroderma was checked for plausibility by admedicum, supplemented, adapted and prepared in such a way that it reached as many patients as possible in a short time, both on paper and via an online survey. "The company admedicum did not only have large empathy and understood the problems, it dealt also so sovereignly with us, as if we would know each other already for years and let feel that we are all on equal eye level.
                                <br>
                                The survey showed that a high percentage of patients benefit enormously from the therapy - both medically and in everyday life. "We finally had in our hands what we had known and experienced for years - but never in numbers and never according to different criteria could we question and evaluate.
                                <br>
                                The DNSS experts were enthusiastic about the results and admedicum's competence and will prepare a scientific analysis on the basis of the survey, which without admedicum could not have been implemented in this way in terms of content, form or substance. This can be an important first step for the approval of the therapy and a cost assumption by the health insurance companies and thus an important step towards an improved care of scleroderma patients.

                              <div class="card-content-open font-is-20 tk-canada-type-gibson" style="position: unset;"> During his time as CEO of Mukoviszidose e.V., the German Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Association (2002 – 2014) and Managing Director of our research affiliate, Mukoviszidose Institut GmbH (2006 – 2015), I got to appreciate Andreas Reimann. I am a father of a son living with CF and I am grateful to what Andreas has contributed to the lives of CF-patients and their beloved ones.
                                <br>
                                Andreas could combine a human attitude and professionalism to the benefit of the patients. He helped to foster the association to an even higher reputation, both nationally and internationally. He managed to raise awareness in the public and fostered support in health-policy for the objectives of CF-patients. This again helped to bring CF into the focus of research and medical care. Thanks to his prudent financial management and his good relationship with major donors, the association could raise sufficient funds to foster research and therapy and to promote important international projects. Andreas always had an impact on patients and relatives in mind when making research and care a priority of our activities. He also encouraged patient activists in the association and co-operated with pharmaceutical companies on eye-level always keeping in mind that transparency and independence of the patient organisation must never be compromised with.
                                <br>
                                How much he cared about all people living with rare diseases is underpinned by his volunteer work as vice-president and later on as president of ACHSE, the German umbrella organisation for rare diseases.
                                <br>
                                If one day we manage to overcome CF, Dr. Reimann has contributed his share. He reminded decision-makers in Germany on their responsibility on the life of patients living with severe chronic diseases</div>

                                <br>
                                For more than 30 years, I have promoted genetic diseases and pain awareness as a health professional with a genetic disease and chronic pain. I fully appreciate how crucial the needs for patient organizations and the mediation required by people like Philipp,  highly capable of collaborating, organizing, and following through, all essential to ensure the patient voice is heard, understood,  and brought directly to the industry.
                                <br>
                                For three years, I witnessed Phillip's commitment to patient organization collaborations. His skills, talents and abilities are exactly what patient organizations need --- and precisely what the industry requires,  to help bring  new ideas for treatment modalities into fruition.</div>

                              <div class="card-content-open font-is-20 tk-canada-type-gibson" style="position: unset;">By systematically involving 390 myotonia patients across 18 European countries through the project MYOPATH, admedicum® was instrumental in demonstrating EMA the great need for patient access to Namuscla® (mexiletine). The EMA Committee of Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) explicitly highlighted the quality of the MYOPATH survey methodology that led to the capture of important information regarding a lack of treatment access resulting in patient harm.
                                <br>
                                The COMP concluded that the sponsor’s structured survey (Note: done by admedicum) which used a well-defined methodology together with the review done by COMP members demonstrated that the availability of mexiletine was limited and disrupted in the EU and that resulted in patient harm, particularly in patients with non-dystrophic myotonia. It is therefore established that Namuscla® will bring significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
                                <br>
                                As a consequence COMP maintained the orphan drug status of Namuscla® which will significantly support patient access across Europe in the years to come. admedicum® thereby helped the Lupin Namuscla® team to create great value both for patients and the company.</div>

I had a chance to talk to many of the families and I know they appreciated these days and loved how much opportunity they had to participate and tell their stories and help shape the field and advance it. This was truly the first patient-centric meeting I’ve ever attended, and that was very much thanks to Philipp‘s vision.

I especially appreciated hearing directly from the caregivers their needs and wants for clinical trials and new medications.“</div>
