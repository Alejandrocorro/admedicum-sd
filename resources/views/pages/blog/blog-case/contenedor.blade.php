                    admedicum is proud to announce the launch of a new European Alliance for Newborn Screening (NBS) in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in partnership with SMA Europe. admedicum is the Secretariat in this initiative and is supporting the Alliance members in advocating for newborn screening programmes to include SMA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Allianceâ€™s main objectives are to decrease the time it takes for a child born with spinal muscular atrophy to be diagnosed and to assist patient advocacy groups in their efforts to accelerate the identification of such children, given that early diagnosis and treatment of spinal muscular atrophy lead to better outcomes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early detection and diagnosis may mean the difference between life and death for an infant with a severe form of SMA. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to advocate for newborn screening for SMA in Europe, SMA Europe founded the Alliance to bring together all stakeholders who share this vision and are willing to work together towards making it a reality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The founding members of this Alliance include the 19 national SMA patient organisations that are members of SMA Europe; EURORDIS - Rare Diseases Europe; the European Alliance of Neuromuscular Disorders Associations (EAMDA); TREAT-NMD; and the companies AveXis, Biogen, and Roche.

                    The Alliance demands that by 2025, newborn screening programmes in Europe include a test for spinal muscular atrophy for all newborn children. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alliance members will take part in a variety of activities including writing a White Paper on newborn screening in SMA that collects the scientific evidence in support of including SMA in the national newborn screening programmes.
                <p>
                    Additionally, Alliance members will advocate in their respective countries for evaluation and inclusion of SMA in newborn screening panels.

                    Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive, neuromuscular disease that leads to immobility and results in a short life expectancy for many children diagnosed with the disease. The incidence of SMA is approximately 1 in 8,000 people, depending on the country. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being a rare disease, if left untreated, SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers. SMA involves the loss of nerve cells called motor neurons that control muscles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once lost, motor neurons cannot be regenerated. 50-60% of children born with SMA can never sit up independently and without treatment do not usually live beyond two years of age. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no cure for SMA but as of August 2020, there are two treatments approved in Europe that can preserve motor neurons. Being treated as early as possible is therefore crucial for babies born with SMA and their families.
